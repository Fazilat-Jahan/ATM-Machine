# ATM-Machine. 

This ATM Machine program is a command-line application built using TypeScript/Node.js and the Inquirer library. It allows users to perform basic ATM operations such as checking balance, withdrawing money, and fast cash withdrawal.

Upon running the program, you will be prompted to enter a PIN code. The default PIN code is set to 1010.

Once you enter the correct PIN code, you will be presented with options to perform various operations:

Withdraw: Enter the amount you want to withdraw from your account. If the amount exceeds your current balance, you will receive an "Insufficient Amount" message.

Fast Cash: Choose from preset cash amounts (e.g., $500, $1000, $5000) for quick withdrawal. Again, the program checks for sufficient balance before processing the withdrawal.

Check Balance: View your current account balance.

If you're intrigued and want to try it, just enter the command "npx builtin-atm-machine" on your cmd.
